%***DAN: Next steps:
%Write to Ellner asking question about scaling factors
%Decide what we ought to be computing 
%Write Methods correspondingly
%Talk to Jasmin about it - did I miss anything that we already computed?
%Then work with Jasmin to get the code edited to compute that stuff
%Write results
%Once results have solidified, make a code suite version that is clean

%Some things we want to be doing
%1) Want proofs, maybe in Methods or maybe in sup mat referenced by methods, that, for our two noise 
%cases it does not matter which, and also that only mu_1 - mu_2 matters, not mu_1 and mu_2 independently.
%2) So for various mu1-mu2 and delta, we will plot all the components against sigma, so we can compare 

%Here is what you see in the sup mat stuff already written
%1) The model (to be cut)
%2) How to generate the noise - keep this, just mntion it in Methods
%3) Lots of stuff on how to efficiently calculate all the parts of ordinary storage effects (which includes the 
%invasion growth rate of species 1, which is of interest in its own right)
%4) sd(r_1) (which is sd(r_{1 \bs 1}) in the enw notation)
%5) P[r_1>0]
%6) E[r_1 | r_1>0]
%7) Whole distribution of r_1 in some special cases
%All the above items 4-7 are all selected to help contrast overall coexistence in these different tail assoc cases

Pssible way to set out goals
1) investigate to wht extent asymmetries of tail asociation may make a difference for coexistence using the lottery model
  could show different values and distributions of r_1 for the different cases, and related quantities
  could look at some of the theory for this - diagrams of wht values of b_1 and b_2 give positive r_1
  would this just basically be examples? Or would you do systematic plots?
  the conclusion would be "it can make a difference to coexistence"
  Is this also where you would put the sims Jasmin did that measure coexistence is another way besides r_1\1? Probably yes.
2) invstigate what mechanisms of coexistence are influenced by tail assoc, and how? 
  We could do this, but the problem is we're going to dispense with the first part of this pretty quickly purely theoretically, so does
  it merit a whole goal? Well, combined with the second part it is OK. The "and how" is the second part, it's the whole decomp
We would then want to specify even in the last para of the Intro that we make this whole decomp. And a third goal, accomplished 
in the Discussion, indicates how the decomp can be used for other models, and for datasets (though the model part may be mainly
accomplished in the theory.

This is reasonable but it makes it hard to have a theory section ahead of a Methods and Results because goal 2 
largely accomplished in theory and goal 1 in methods and results!

What if we have a non-traditional structure, where you do G1, theory/methods, then G1 results, then G2 theory/methods then
G2 results, the discussion? That would work but can we write a short paper that way?

What would a theory/methods for G1 look like?
The model and the noise (a quick para, details for th noise in sup mat)
Theory showing only mu1-mu2 matters, and that right/left does not matter, and statement that we can assume mu1<mu2
Choice to use r_1/1, derivation of the exression for r_1\1, and ref to sup mat fo rapid calculation of it
Metrics based on r_1/1 ()
Other metrics of coexistence based on sims
We plot these aainst mu1-mu2 and sigma for a few different delta (one value of delta in the main text, others in sup mat)
One figure only (two if you count the noise fig which is fig 1)
The whole point here would just be to show a difference
You could have a second fig show the whole disstribution of r_1\1 for a couple examples, or this could be additonal panels on the main fig

What if we turned this on its head and put the theory first, and then did sims the goal of which would be
to show that the theory is valuable by showing that the new decomp of storage effects is a meaningfully large
thing? Is't that similar anyway, since the I^(ata) is just the effects of tail assoc. Yes! So we just need to
argue that quantity is appreciably large compared to other mechanisms. This would be betrer since we could then
have a Theory section that led the Method and Results and have a more traditional format.

So let's try this again. Goalss:
1) To augment the MTC to show how asymmetric tail association (ATA) plays a role (reword)
The MTC decomposes a measure of coexistence into components due to each of several mechanisms. We address
how ATA and correlation per se contribute to these components.
2) To explore using a simple model the relative magnitude of the contributions to coexistence that come
ATA compared to correlation per se.

Is this is headed in a better direction?

OK, then what would we plot when accomplishing goal 2? Well, we could plot each mechanism against sigma for a few mu1-mu2 on a panel, then show more such panels in the sup mat for other delta (we coud even show a few panels one with each delta, no problem)? We'd how the ATA mechanism would be meaningfully big compared to the others, at least sometimes.
Also, doesn't this leave out the sim-based studies of the importance of ATA using other metrics of coexistence? Would we put that
in the sup mat or what? We could. We could also put in sup mat the other plots of metrics related to r_1\1, justifying
it all as other ways of visualizing effects of ATA on coexistence.
We could have a theoretical fig showing why ATA matters for r_1\1 - the thing I drew on the board once for Jasmin, works
only for the lottery model. Dan, can you dig more into that to explain it? Gneeralize it?

Figs via the second way
1) pedagog fig showing what tail assoc is, also later used for introing the noise we use, in methods
2) pedgog fig showing a simple set of sims, somehow, the only difference being ATA, showing good things 
happening in one panel and bad in another - cited in Intro, only serves to prove to people that ATA matters for 
coexistence, so they keep reading
3) Fig with a grid of panels, each panel plots against sigma, and the grid controls a few values of 
delta and a few of mu1-mu2. Plotted is all the components of coexistence, for comparison.
4) Theoretical fig exploring why ATA matters to r_1\1 for the lottery model and hopefully more gernerally - try to get
at the intuition here. See if you can edge to more generality here, or not?

Methods, the second way:
1) Describe noise - only a few sentences at the most, details in sup mat. Maybe just one sentence.
2) To achieve goal G2 from the Introduction, we plotted the terms ... of the our extended MTC for the lottery model 
against the free parameters ..., comparing the relative magnitudes of these terms to see if and when contributions of ATA 
to coexistence were appreciable.   
Some analytic shortcuts, summarized here, greatly simplified this plotting. Then explain... 
Want proofs, maybe in Methods or maybe in sup mat referenced by methods, that, for our two noise 
cases it does not matter which, and also that only mu_1 - mu_2 matters, not mu_1 and mu_2 independently.
Might need a couple paragraphs?

Some cut text I may still need below:

\vspace{2in}

\noindent By substituting the definitions,

\begin{align}
\bar r_i &=\EX(\ln(1-\delta + \frac{B_i}{B_2/ \delta})) \\
&= \EX(\ln(1-\delta +\delta \frac{B_i}{B_2})) 
\end{align}

The null growth rate of species $i$ is computed by setting both E and C at their means. 

\begin{align}
\epsilon_i^0 &=\ln(1-\delta + \frac{\bar E_i}{\bar C_i}) \\
&=\ln(1-\delta + \delta \frac{\bar B_i}{\bar B_2}) 
\end{align}

The contribution of variance E in to the IGR is computed by setting C to its mean and letting E vary subtracted by the null. 

\begin{align}
\epsilon_i^E &=\ln(1-\delta + \frac{E_i}{\bar C_i}) -  \epsilon_i^0 \\
&=\ln(1-\delta + \delta \frac{B_i}{\bar B_2}) -  \epsilon_i^0 
\end{align}

\begin{equation}
\bar \epsilon_i^E=\EX(\epsilon_i^E) \label{Evar_mean}
\end{equation}

Similarly, the contribution of variance C in to the IGR is computed by setting E to its mean and letting C vary subtracted by the null. 

\begin{align}
\epsilon_i^C &=\ln(1-\delta + \frac{\bar E_i}{C_i}) -  \epsilon_i^0 \\
 &=\ln(1-\delta + \delta \frac{\bar B_i}{ B_2}) -  \epsilon_i^0 
\end{align}

\begin{equation}
\bar \epsilon_i^C=\EX(\epsilon_i^C) \label{Cvar_mean}
\end{equation}

The contribution of both E and C varying to the IGR is computed by letting both variables vary subtracted by the null and the contributions of only one variable varying.

\begin{equation}
\epsilon_i^{EC}=\ln(1-\delta + \delta \frac{B_i}{B_j}) -  [\epsilon_i^0 + \epsilon_i^E + \epsilon_i^C] \label{ECvar}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
\bar \epsilon_i^{EC}=\EX(\ln(1-\delta + \delta \frac{B_i}{B_j})) -[\epsilon_i^0 +\bar \epsilon_i^E + \bar \epsilon_i^C] \label{ECvar_mean}
\end{equation}

So,

\begin{equation}
\bar r_i=\epsilon_i^0 +\bar \epsilon_i^E + \bar \epsilon_i^C + \bar \epsilon_i^{EC}. \label{rbari_decomp}
\end{equation}

But some of $\bar \epsilon_i^{EC}$ comes from covariance between E and C and some comes from both varying independently.

\begin{align}
\bar \epsilon_i^{(E\#C)} &=\EX(\ln(1-\delta + \frac{E_i}{C_i^{\#}})) -[\epsilon_i^0 +\bar \epsilon_i^E + \bar \epsilon_i^C] \\
 &=\EX(\ln(1-\delta + \delta \frac{B_i}{B_2^{\#}})) -[\epsilon_i^0 +\bar \epsilon_i^E + \bar \epsilon_i^C] 
\end{align}

\begin{align}
\bar \epsilon_i^{(EC)} &=\bar \epsilon_i^{EC}-\bar \epsilon_i^{(E\#C)}\\
&= \EX(\ln(1-\delta + \frac{E_i}{C_i}))-[\epsilon_i^0 +\bar \epsilon_i^E + \bar \epsilon_i^C]\\
&- [\EX(\ln(1-\delta + \frac{E_i}{C_i^{\#}})) -[\epsilon_i^0 +\bar \epsilon_i^E + \bar \epsilon_i^C]] \\
&= \EX(\ln(1-\delta + \delta \frac{B_i}{B_2}))-\epsilon_i^0 -\bar \epsilon_i^E - \bar \epsilon_i^C\\
&- \EX(\ln(1-\delta + \delta \frac{B_i}{B_2^{\#}})) +\epsilon_i^0 +\bar \epsilon_i^E + \bar \epsilon_i^C \\
&= \EX(\ln(1-\delta + \delta \frac{B_i}{B_2}))-\EX(\ln(1-\delta + \delta \frac{B_i}{B_2^{\#}}))\\
\end{align}
